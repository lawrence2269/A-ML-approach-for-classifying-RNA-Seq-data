#### Abstract
<p align="justify">
In this study, we aim to predict the invasiveness of cancer subtypes by using a supervised machine learning approach such as SVM, Random Forests, and Decision Tree. We will base on the next-generation RNA sequence data of cancer cells and cancer-associated immune cells to classify the cancerous cells from immune cells in the given samples taken from cancer patients and compare the classification/prediction performance of machine learning models such as SVM, decision tree, random forest, hierarchical clustering, etc. and choose the model that performs better. 

The evolution of genomic sequencing technology has led researchers to perform various experiments to find a cure for various genetic diseases such as cancer. The advent of Artificial Intelligence, especially in the healthcare sector has paved the way to numerous solutions such as drug discovery, cost-effective treatment for patients, etc. which would be beneficial for pharmaceutical organizations, hospitals, and researchers to perform their experiments at a fast pace. Further, Next-generation RNA sequencing data has helped to find the relationship between gene expression profiles and different developmental stages of a cell or a disease in an efficient and cost-effective approach with higher accuracy. There are various methodologies mentioned in various literature related to a cure for cancer, still, the fatality rate of cancer cannot be reduced. The machine learning approach helps us to understand the complexities and processes of cancer samples that lead to the development of effective cancer treatment/drugs in a reliable, fast, and efficient way.</p>
